# Upstream Live  

**Upstream Live** is a secure, internal-facing web platform designed for the **Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC)** to streamline operations, improve communication, and centralize upstream data access. The system is intended for staff members across various departments, with **ICT (Networking, Cybersecurity, and App Development)** playing a central role in implementation and support.

## Project Overview  

The oil and gas sector in Nigeria relies heavily on accurate, real-time data for effective regulation and decision-making. Currently, information is fragmented across departments, making collaboration and monitoring difficult.  

**Upstream Live** provides a single, secure entry point for NUPRC staff to:  
- Access upstream petroleum data and resources.  
- Improve inter-departmental collaboration.  
- Enhance accountability and operational transparency.  
- Securely log in using official NUPRC work emails and passwords.  

By requiring official work emails, the system ensures only verified NUPRC staff can gain access.

## Key Features  

- **Secure Authentication** – Staff can only log in using NUPRC-issued email addresses.  
- **Department-Specific Access Control** – Ensures that only authorized departments gain access to relevant data.  
- **ICT Oversight** – Strong involvement of the ICT department (Networking, Cybersecurity, App Development) to maintain security, efficiency, and compliance.  
- **Scalability** – Built to support future integrations, new tools, and potential API connections.  
- **User-Friendly Dashboard** – Centralized platform for accessing key resources with an intuitive interface.

## Impact on the Nigerian Oil & Gas Sector  

- **Improved Regulation** – Provides NUPRC with a more efficient way to monitor upstream activities.  
- **Data Centralization** – Reduces redundancy by eliminating fragmented departmental silos.  
- **Transparency** – Ensures secure, auditable access to sensitive data.  
- **Future-Ready** – Positioned to integrate with automation, AI, and data analytics tools for smarter regulation.

## Technology Stack  

The platform will be developed using:  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (for interactive dashboards).  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Python (REST API for secure data handling).  
- **Database**: Cloud SQL (for upstream data storage and retrieval).  
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication, role-based access control, and continuous monitoring by ICT.  

---

## Project Status  

Currently in **development phase** under the NUPRC ICT Department – App Development Division. Contributions are focused on:  
- Setting up the repository and project structure.  
- Implementing secure login/authentication.  
- Designing the user dashboard.
